üìä Predicting Customer Attrition: Data-Driven Insights for Retention
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning. The objective is to empower organizations with a data-driven framework to proactively identify high-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

The solution was designed to not only prioritize model performance but also ensure interpretability and stakeholder value. The analysis highlights the key behavioral drivers of churn and delivers a reliable, explainable model ready for deployment.

üß† Project Goals
Detect customers likely to churn (attrite) from the bank.

Understand why customers leave by identifying the most influential features.

Build a predictive model that balances accuracy, recall, and interpretability.

Equip business teams with insights to design targeted retention campaigns.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps Undertaken
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed ID columns to avoid data leakage.

Encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE to ensure fair learning for churn cases.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized churn patterns across demographic and transactional variables.

Identified key churn signals such as transaction count, spending trends, and utilization ratios.

Modeling
Three models were trained and evaluated:

Model	Purpose	ROC-AUC	Recall (Churn)
Random Forest	Robust baseline model	0.986	85.4%
XGBoost (Base)	Improve recall, regularization support	0.987	90.2%
XGBoost (Tuned)	Best performance, hyperparameter optimized	0.993	90.7%

Model Explainability

Applied SHAP values and feature importance charts.

Top churn predictors:
Total_Trans_Count, Total_Trans_Amount, Total_Revolving_Balance, Avg_Utilization_Ratio.

Evaluation

Used ROC-AUC as the primary metric to assess model performance across thresholds.

Final tuned model achieved 97.2% accuracy and strong recall‚Äîideal for minimizing missed churn cases.

üìå Key Takeaways for Stakeholders
High churn risk is linked to disengagement‚Äîfewer transactions, reduced spending, and declining activity.

The deployed model can flag at-risk customers early, enabling timely interventions such as rewards, personal outreach, or service upgrades.

The approach is both data-backed and explainable, making it suitable for business use and trust.



üèÅ Final Note
This project bridges data science and business strategy. By identifying patterns that drive customer attrition and using predictive models to flag churn risk, organizations can shift from reactive to proactive customer retention.
